# Project Title
This website enables students to register a hall and a room. There's a page that enables students to register as a student and then choose a hall and room. If the student has already registered, he or she just has to log in and select.

### Process 
### Prerequisites

Mongoose, nodejs and express were required in order for them to be used. Bcrypt was also used to hash the password. This is how it was done.

let express = require('express');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
 let mongoose = require('mongoose');

### Break down 

There's an 'index.js' file which has all the routes and the various code for the backend
The 'index.ejs' page has two buttons which enable students to register or sign up
The 'reg.ejs' page enables students to register
The 'save.ejs' page enables students to choose a hall and room
The 'display.ejs' page shows the students name as well as the hall and room he or she has chosen.
The 'style.css' page has all the styling for the page


When the student registers, the information goes into the database.
